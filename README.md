## Description

* This is a game I drew and programed in a month. 

## Instructions

* W to move up
* A to move left
* S to move down
* D to move right 
* SPACE BAR to shoot 
* MOUSE to aim 

### How to play the game 

* Open the GameMaker executable to play the game. 

## Programs Used

Gamemaker Language 
* It's a simple language I like using.

ColorZilla
* To get colors for the art.

Discord 
* I used this to download music from Noah who made music for the game and to talk with my friend Marcus who helped with the code. 

## Purpose

* In the future I want to be paid to make games so I made this program to show off what I can do.

## Function

* The function of this game is to be an enjoyable experence for the player to play.  

## Abstractions

* Abstractions are everywhere in games, An example for this game is when a button press causes the player to move.
